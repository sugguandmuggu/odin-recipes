# odin-recipes
This is a project to create a website to showcase some recipes. I will make use of HTML tags and attributes to create this website. Tags like h1 to h6 (probably not going to use all of them) for headings of differing importance, <p> for different paragraphs, <a> for links ( need to use "href" for it to actually work) etc etc.
